One day a young man was walking through the forest when he came across a huge, old oak tree. The tree was so large that the man could not wrap his arms around it. He sat down at the base of the tree and rested his head against its trunk. As he closed his eyes, he felt a warm presence within him and he heard a voice speak to him.

"My child, I am an old oak tree and I have been alive for many years. In my time, I have seen many things come and go. I have seen people be born and die; I have seen empires rise and fall. Through it all, I have learned one thing: life is fleeting."

The young man opened his eyes and looked up at the old oak tree. "What do you mean?" he asked.

"I mean that life is short," replied the old oak tree. "It can be gone in an instant."

The young man thought about this for a moment before asking another question. "But what is the point of life then?" he asked. "If it's so short, what is the point of living?"


"That's a question that has puzzled people for centuries," said the old oak tree. "Some people believe that life is a test, others believe that it is something to be enjoyed while we are here on earth." The old oak paused for a moment before continuing speaking again in its wise voice:

"No matter what you believe though, one thing is certain: we only get one chance at life."
