As the old saying goes, "the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry." Such was the case for one small mouse who had planned to steal a piece of cheese from a trap set by a human. The mouse had successfully stolen cheese from this trap before, but this time was different. This time, the cheese was poisoned.
