Write a parable which teaches an important life lesson


One day a farmer went out to sow his seed. Some of the seed fell on the path and was eaten by the birds. Some of the seed fell on rocky ground where it couldn't take root. But some of the seed fell on good soil and grew and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!

The lesson is this: Be careful where you sow your seeds because you will get what you plant.
